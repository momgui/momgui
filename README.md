# About Me

Hey there! ğŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub page! 

I'm a student currently pursuing a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay. ğŸ“š My passion lies in exploring the intersection of these two fields, particularly in the realm of automated trading. ğŸ’¹

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of automated trading and developing bots that can execute trades autonomously. ğŸ¤– You can check the website project with the link bellow ğŸ˜Š
